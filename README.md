# AI-ML Breast Cancer Predictor
- The number of deaths caused by breast cancer is dramatically rising each year. It is the most prevalent form of cancer and the leading global cause of mortality for women. For a healthy life, any advancement in cancer illness prediction and detection is crucial. As a result, accurate cancer prognosis is crucial to updating the treatment standard and patient survival rate. Machine learning methods have become a focus of research and have been demonstrated to be effective in the early detection and prediction of breast cancer.

- From the data set obtained from Hospital and ML algorithm we predict the accuracy of abnormalties in Genes from which we can predict if the person is having Malignant or Benign type of Breast Cancer.
